# Music Mixer - Authoring 2

This project was made over the course of term 2 at Fanshawe College for the Interactive Media Design Program. I also learned some key concepts in my first term.

## Motivation

I tried my best. I really was motivated to figure out the questions that I need answered. While I couldn't find all of them, I was motivated.

## Usage

If someone wanted to make web music. Also I could pick this project up later in life and try to make it better. It could be used to help me understand JS. I need work.

## inspiration

Inspiried by Fanshawe.
